# Fake News Predictive System

# Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at detecting fake news. The project uses a dataset of labeled news articles to train a model that can distinguish between real and fake news based on the content, title, and author of the articles.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It includes news articles with various features, labeled as real or fake. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

train.csv: Contains features such as article ID, title, author, text, and a label (real or fake).
test.csv: Similar to the training set but without labels, used for testing the model's performance.
submit.csv: A format for submitting model predictions.
To access the dataset, visit the Kaggle Dataset Page.

Installation
To get started with the project:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install necessary Python packages (a requirements.txt file may be included for ease of setup).
Usage
The project's code is primarily in the fake_new_predictive_system.ipynb Jupyter notebook. It includes the steps for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

To run the notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
Open fake_new_predictive_system.ipynb.
Execute the notebook cells sequentially.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome, and they can be in various forms:

Enhancing the predictive model
Proposing or adding new features
Improving data preprocessing
Resolving bugs or issues
Fork the repository and create a pull request with your proposed changes.

Acknowledgments
A special thanks to Kaggle for providing the dataset used in this project. The dataset is instrumental in enabling the research and development of the fake news detection model.
